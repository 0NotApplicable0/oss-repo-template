## Interesting Projects Wiki
Like I've said before, I really don't care what type of project I work on. I joined the OSS class to learn about open source licences and the structure of open souce software. Maybe one project idea I could work on would be automated homeless food distribution systems.

The problem area of the software I am trying to create is auto food distibution to the homeless in big cities. I don't think there is existing software that does this. In big cities there would be automated distribution boxes. Homeless people walk up and scan their face. After that a care package will be distibuted. We would use a full stack system. Node or dotnet for the backend, and maybe typescript React or C# blazor for the frontend. The end goal would be to feed the homeless in big cities.

## Gitstats
When getting the data manually it was a long process of manually moving around and typing things in. Gitstats was much more automated and it seems like Gitstats also showed some more information. For example, the number of contributors was different in Gitstats than the manual process for the Insomnia Diaogue System.
