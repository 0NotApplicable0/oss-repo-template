### Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
It is super important to choose a license beacuse if you don't then people will not know how to use your licenced content. For example, if you dont attach a licence and someone uses your code the people using your code could be sued. Giving an explicit licence to a project defines a strict set of rules in which people can use your project. In fact, if you publish something to the public domain, in the United States at least, that content still technically belongs to you! So if your whole point of the project is to share the code then you are really doing the opposite.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
Like I stated above, when something is put out into the public domain without a licence it still technically belongs to the creator. So if you take that code and use it you could then be sued down the line because there is no license stating you can use the project.

### Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.
I do agree that the web beat Gopher. The article states that, "This had the practical shortcoming of significantly reducing the number of people who could be working to make necessary changes to Gopher.", and I agree with this completly. Opening up your project early allows a lot of people to get on board  and start adding changes. Another issue with Gopher is their mindset to control everything. Openning a project up allows the developers to create a thinktank in the issues section to determine what should be done next. If the project creator decides to take control then the project will just become froked like what happend to Gopher.

### Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.
The big deal of .NET Core was its capability to be cross-platform. Meaning Microsoft wanted to support Linux and MacOS. Supporting three platforms is a huge undertaking and open source is a really easy way of doing it. From this [article](https://www.cio.com/article/3026664/the-real-reason-microsoft-open-sourced-net.html) it says that Microsoft wanted to support multiple platforms and even on their [website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) it says "One Platform". I think Micrsoft switched to open source to better fit the goals of the project. Also, Microsoft has their own operating system Windows to worry about and I would think that not a whole lot of people at Microsoft know about Linux or MacOS so open sourcing it will help progress the project signiflicatly.
