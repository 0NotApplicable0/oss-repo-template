## Checkpoint 3

### Test image 1:

Full Size: 

![fulltest1](test_image_1.PNG)

Scaled:

![scaledtest1](scaled_test_image_1.PNG)

Output: 

![outputtest1](test_image_1_output.PNG)

This worked great, got it 100%

### Test image 2:

Full Size:

![fulltest1](test_image_2.PNG)

Scaled:

![scaledtest1](scaled_test_image_2.PNG)

Output:

![outputtest1](test_image_2_output.PNG)

This almost got there, it was split between whether it was a 
sneaker or a sandal and ended up going with sandal. It also somewhat
thought it was a shirt.

### Test image 3:

Full Size:

![fulltest1](test_image_3.PNG)

Scaled:

![scaledtest1](scaled_test_image_3.PNG)

Output:

![outputtest1](test_image_3_output.PNG)

This one was also 100% and got it right!
